# Extended Kalman Filter for Pose Estimation (Bearing Only)

This project is a solution to an exercise from the Probabilistic Robotics course by [Prof. Giorgio Grisetti](https://sites.google.com/dis.uniroma1.it/grisetti/home?authuser=0), Sapienza University of Rome. The original repository with all the material can be found at this [link](https://gitlab.com/grisetti/probabilistic_robotics_2024_25). 

## Enviroment 

The environment is a 2D world consisting of a robot and a series of landmarks. Each landmark communicates an angle to the robot, which represents the measured angle from the landmark to the robot. This angle is expressed relative to the robot's reference frame.
